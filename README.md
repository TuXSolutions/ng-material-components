Thanks to:

*** How To Use




```
npm install -g angular-cli
ng new <app name>
cd <app name>

npm install --save ng-material-components
```

then, edit the style.css file from you angular app and import the css of the library. Add the following line

```scss
@import '../node_modules/ng-material-components/bundles/app.css';
```

And that should be it. 

I am working on a new demo site that will allow you to easily copy and paste sample code to test all the library controls
into your app.

Enjoy!

(More documentation is coming)
